/***************************** Actor Address **********************************/
/******************************************************************************/

/// Uniquely identifies a distributed actor, and enables sending messages even to remote actors.
///
/// ## Identity
/// The address is the source of truth with regards to referring to a _specific_ actor in the system.
/// This is in contrast to an `ActorPath` which can be thought of as paths in a filesystem, however without any uniqueness
/// or identity guarantees about the files those paths point to.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
/// Note, that an ActorAddress is a pure value, and as such does not "participate" in an actors lifecycle;
/// Thus, it may represent an address of an actor that has already terminated, so attempts to locate (resolve)
/// an `ActorRef` for this address may result with a reference to dead letters (meaning, that the actor this address
/// had pointed to does not exist, and most likely is dead / terminated).
///
/// ## Serialization
///
/// An address can be serialized using `Codable` or other serialization mechanisms.
/// When shared over the network or with other processes it must include the origin's
/// system address (e.g. the network address of the host, or process identifier).
///
/// When using `Codable` serialization this is done automatically, by looking up
/// the address of the `ActorTransport` the actor is associated with if was a local
/// instance, or simply carrying the full address if it already was a remote reference.
///
/// ## Format
/// The address consists of the following parts:
///
/// ```
/// |              node                  | path               | incarnation |
///  (  protocol | name? | host | port  ) ( [segments] name )? (  uint32   )
/// ```
///
/// For example: `sact://human-readable-name@127.0.0.1:7337/user/wallet/id-121242`.
/// Note that the `ActorIncarnation` is not printed by default in the String representation of a path, yet may be inspected on demand.
